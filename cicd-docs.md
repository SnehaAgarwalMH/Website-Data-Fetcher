# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The CI/CD process automates testing and deployment tasks when code changes are pushed to the repository.

## Workflows
- `data_fetcher.yml`: Defines the workflow for automating data fetching tasks.

## Configuration
The workflow is configured with specific steps to execute automated data collection. You can customize this workflow to suit your project's requirements.

## Usage
To use the CI/CD workflow, ensure that your repository contains the required scripts and dependencies. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow when code changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Documentation
For detailed information on setting up and customizing CI/CD workflows, refer to the [CI/CD Documentation](/docs/cicd-docs.md).

For details on using the data fetching scripts, check the [Documentation](/docs/README.md).
